A top-down adventure/shooter game made for Miz Jam 1 in 48 non-consecutive hours over the course of a week. The project has been both my first game jam and first publicly released game. The game was made entirely in JavaScript, with a simple engine I built for the jam, taking inspiration from my university coursework from Graphical Systems.

The game's main mechanic is a weapon that pushes the player back with the force of its recoil, which can be used to jump over gaps and knock enemies into hazards. It contains 28 non-linear stages, four distinct enemy types who force the player to use the recoil mechanic in different ways, platforming challenges, plenty of bugs and wonky hit detection, two original music tracks, and a final boss battle.

As is usual for game jams with tight time constraints, while the core code made earlier in the jam is polished, some of the later features added such as audio and the boss enemy were rather hastily added and don't abide at all by good software design principles.
